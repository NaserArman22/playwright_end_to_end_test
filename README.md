# End-to-End Automation Testing of DailyFinance Portal with Playwright

---
### Project Overview    
This project is an end-to-end UI automation testing suite for DailyFinance using **Playwright**, designed with a clean **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture. It automates the complete user journey starting from registration, programmatically accessing the Gmail inbox via the Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 to verify the congratulation email and asserting the toast messageâ€”then logging in, adding two random items and confirming their presence, uploading a profile picture in settings, logging out, performing a password reset via the login page by entering the email and sending a reset link, again programmatically fetching the reset email through the Gmail API, extracting the reset link, completing the password reset process, and finally logging in again with the new password to ensure successful authentication. Sensitive data and configuration are securely managed through dedicated files for maintainability and scalability.
